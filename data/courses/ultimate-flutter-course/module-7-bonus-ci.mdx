# CI - Continues Integration

  

CI is the base of any good workflow. There are multiple ways of doing it and this is just one way. I mostly opt to use [Codemagic](https://codemagic.io/start/) as a lot of things are handled for you but I do from time to time utilize other services such as [GitHub actions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpQKpXjH5vs) etc.

  

Both Codemagic and GitHub Actions (private repository) have build minute limitations for the free plan, in these cases, I often opt of using a combination. For example, I may use [GitHub Actions for running](https://github.com/RobertBrunhage/budget_together/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml) tests but Codemagic for building and publishing.

  

Some other services are:

[Bitrise](https://www.bitrise.io/)

[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)

[Octopus](https://octopus.com/) (Paid but works great together with Codemagic)
