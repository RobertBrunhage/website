## Package Multiple Result

The reason I use this package is that its [implementation](https://github.com/higorlapa/result) is very small with a good amount of tests. With this package, we get a couple of new types/objects that we can use.

  

## Result - Failure | OurOtherType

With `Result<Failure, OurOtherType`, we specify that our type can be either a Failure or the specific type we use in the code. This lets us return a value if we are successful with the **try** clause or return a failure in the **catch** clause. When we later call this we have to handle it which makes the implementation needed in the **controller** minimal.

  

## Success

This is the object we wrap the value we wanted to return to our **controller** and of course should represent the value of the successful data we got back.

  

## Error

This is the object we wrap our custom **failure** object with. This will be handled in the controller the same way as the **success** object.

  

## .when()

This is the method we use on our returned results from the **Service**. This will force us to handle both the success and the failure cases. In our **controller,** it becomes very easy to understand and read.
