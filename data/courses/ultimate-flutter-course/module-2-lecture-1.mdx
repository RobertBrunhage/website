## Immutable state

Now you might be wondering why we are always going with Immutable data. Well, the answer is quite complex but also simple. It forces us to have a **Uni-directional data flow**. But what does that even mean?

  

This means that the state can **ONLY** be changed from **within** the controller and can **not** be mutated from outside the controller (except using methods on the controller). This is great because what this means is that whenever a state changes in a way we did not expect we can always trace it back to the **controller** or a **method** used from it.

  

Comparing to using for example a **mutable** object, there could be cases it's mutated from **outside** the controller, meaning the state changes **doesn't** reflect in the UI/app which can result in some **nasty** hard to locate bugs.

  

This does **not** mean that a mutable state is bad by any means. But from my experience **defaulting** to using **immutable** data greatly simplifies the development long term!
