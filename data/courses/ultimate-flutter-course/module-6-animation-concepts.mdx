## Basic Concepts

The [AnimationController](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/AnimationController-class.html) is used to "drive" the animation, so you can call **forward**, **reverse,** and so on. You usually don't use this on its own but would a lot of the time pair it with something called a [Tween](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Tween-class.html). As a default Animations usually use a **linear curve** but we can change that by using any of the predefined curves available from the [Curves class](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Curve-class.html).

  

You don't need to know these by heart but there is an [amazing resource from the Flutter team](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/animations) if you are new to animations in general
