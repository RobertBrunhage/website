## Fading in images

There are a lot of cool packages such as [this](https://pub.dev/packages/image_fade) but being able to do the core animation ourselves is 1 less dependency for our app. Every dependency is potentially a problem that has to be managed.

  

## Specify a curve

I recommend not just following the example below but also playing around with it. We have with this lecture created a widget to handle a simple fade animation, but try and make it the way you like. There are cool curves that you can test out and see how the animation changes. The important part here is to make it the way you want it.
