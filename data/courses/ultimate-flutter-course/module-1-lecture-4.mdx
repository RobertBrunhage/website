## VoidCallBack

This is a way for us to pass methods through the constructor of widgets/methods.
But what is it really? Well, diving into the definition of it
[in the documentation](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/VoidCallback.html)
we can see that it's only a **typedef** of **void Function()**.

A **typedef** is just a type alias. It lets us do things such as

```dart
typedef IntList = List<int>;
IntList il = [1, 2, 3];
```

If you want to learn more about the different dart features give the
[language tour a read in the dart docs](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour)!
