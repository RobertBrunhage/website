## There will be a bonus module

As promised there will also be a bonus module but that depends on a lot of things before it's actually completed. I already have some topics in mind but do share on Slack if you want me to cover anything specific!

  

## CodeWithAndrea

Do you want to learn more about Animations? [Andrea Bizzotto has an Animation Course](https://codewithandrea.com/courses/flutter-animations-masterclass/?affcode=513495_pxbodly2) (keep in mind that I am an affiliate, but I wholeheartedly recommend it) that is great if you want to dive even deeper into Animations in Flutter!

  

**Don't stop learning**

Hope the course was as enjoyable to go through as it was for me to make, if you have questions or just want to chat and learn from others, don't forget to join our Slack channel! ðŸŽ‰
