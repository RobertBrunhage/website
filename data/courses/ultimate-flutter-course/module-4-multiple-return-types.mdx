## Multiple return types

This is something that is used a great lot in functional programming and can be seen in packages such as [fpdart](https://pub.dev/packages/fpdart). The main drawback is chaining multiple requests but that we can fix it by also utilizing **try-catch**.

  

## Our flow

*   Repository (Will do try-catch)
*   Service (Will also do try-catch but then wrap the results with a **Success** value and a **Failure** value)
*   Controller (We will now, with compile safe code handle either the **Success** or **Failure** value)
