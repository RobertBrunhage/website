## AsyncValue

This is a type provided by the [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/) package. Diving into the [documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/riverpod/latest/riverpod/AsyncValue-class.html) of it we can see that it's a "utility for safely manipulating asynchronous data" which is great because this is exactly what we are going to do!

  

AsyncValue provides three different "states" which are **data**, **loading**, and **error**. It also provides a lot of cool methods that we can utilize for cleaner and more safe UI code such as the **.when** method.

  

## How would it be used?

Imagine you have a type declared in your **state class** such as an image URL that you are going to fetch from an API. You probably expect the API requests to either be **successful**, be in a **loading** state, or **fail** with some kind of **error**/**exception**. So in the case of a normal variable declared for that URL it could look something like this.

  

`final string url;`

  

But using **AsyncValue** is would be like this.

  

`final AsyncValue<string>> url;`
