## Entity

Think of this as the one-to-one mapping for the request you are making. Most of the time you would have a normal model class but in a lot of cases that model class also contains data that you only want in the frontend code. In this case, I highly recommend using some kind of entity class. That way you can keep this class mapped to the API/database while also having a model that you structure the way you want.

  

In most cases, the flow would look like this

  

1.  Make a request and we get the data that can be mapped to an entity.
2.  When passing that entity along for the UI we map it to a model object.
3.  We now only have the data we need as well as additional data or code that we want in the model class.
