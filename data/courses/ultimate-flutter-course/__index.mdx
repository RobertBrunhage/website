## The Ultimate Flutter Course

### Build a complete production-ready Flutterapplication

## What will I get?

### Previous premium course that is now more accessible


This course was a **previously a premium course** that was priced at **$199**.

The course is using Riverpod 1.0 but works with Riverpod 2.0. What the course
teaches is **package agnostic**, meaning that you can replace the packages to
whatever suits you the best.

I highly believe in teaching **core concepts** that are **practical** and you can
apply right away to build good applications rather than just learning about another package.

I do like Riverpod though 😎 The course is quite short ~2h and is highly edited to condence
the information so you don’t have to spend 30-60h on yet another course.
