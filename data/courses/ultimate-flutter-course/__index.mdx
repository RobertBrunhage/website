# What will I get?

## Previous premium course that is now more accessible
<br/><br/>

>This course was **previously a premium course** that was priced at **$199**.
>
>The course is using Riverpod 1.0 but works with Riverpod 2. What the course
>teaches are **package agnostic**, meaning that you can replace the packages to
>whatever suits you the best.
>
>I highly believe in teaching **core concepts** that are **practical** and that you can it
>apply right away to build good applications rather than just learning about another package.
>
>I do like Riverpod though ðŸ˜Ž The course is quite short ~2h and is highly edited to condense
>the information so you donâ€™t have to spend 30-60h on yet another course.
