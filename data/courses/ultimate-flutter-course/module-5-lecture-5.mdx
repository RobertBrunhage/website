## The setup

I always refer my setup to the [docs of the integration package](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/master/packages/integration_test). As well that they give explanations of how you can do things like running the tests on the web, taking screenshots as well as doing cool things like hooking it up with the [Firebase Test Lab](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIs5qVwqW25QIV8iCtBh3DrwyUEAAYASAAEgLFU_D_BwE).

  

## Additional resources

Here is a [video from Reso Coder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izajHHFSa8o) which goes over integration tests as well as hooking it up with **Firebase Test Lab & Codemagic.**

  

**Again** I highly recommend [this series from VGV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_eZg-X789w). They will even go into things like Golden tests if you want to dive even deeper in testing!
