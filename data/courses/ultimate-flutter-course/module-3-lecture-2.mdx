## Entity

Following the [API documentation](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3), we have two requests that we are going to make and then map that to our entities.

  

## Genre Entity

The first one is a genre entity and the API documentation for this can be [found here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/genres/get-movie-list).

  

## Movie Entity

The second one is a movie entity and the API documentation for this can be [found here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie-discover). Remember that some values here are actually **nullable** so we must make sure to handle that.

  

## Image URLs

According to the documentation of the API, we also have to have the correct URL. We get a URL from the requests that we are making for the movies but we also have to keep in mind the [following information](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/images).
