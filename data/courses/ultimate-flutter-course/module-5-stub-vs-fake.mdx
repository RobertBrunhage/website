## Stub vs Fake

I did quite a lot of research here to make sure I didn't say the wrong thing, it turned out that you will always say the wrong thing here ðŸ™ƒ. All of these concepts are explained in a lot of different ways and it doesn't really matter which way you want to understand them as. Here is a long thread on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/346372/whats-the-difference-between-faking-mocking-and-stubbing/55030455#55030455) and the answer I personally liked the most.

  

What is **ACTUALLY** important here is to pick something that makes sense to you and stick with it. In the end, it's just a convention to explain in more detail what the objects are for and even the [Flutter team](https://youtu.be/Yy4NgbqNNtY?t=1304) at times have used Fakes that are not in line with what the concept explained in books are.

  

Fun fact: the video from the [Flutter team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy4NgbqNNtY) is actually a simplified version of what we are doing in this course!
