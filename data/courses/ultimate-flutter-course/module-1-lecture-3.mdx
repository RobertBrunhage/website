## PageController

The documentation probably explains this the best

"A page controller lets you manipulate which page is visible in
aÂ [PageView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/PageView-class.html)"

But as you saw we could also add our custom **curves** to how it would animate
and there are **a lot** of different curves that we can use!
[In the documentation](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Curves-class.html),
they have a range of examples of how curves apply motion to what we want. I
recommend going through it and trying some of the other curves out to see what
you like the most!
