## Animation

The [Animation class](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Animation-class.html) contains a value and a "state" and another important part is that they inherit the [Listenable class](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/Listenable-class.html) which makes it possible to use in combination with widgets like [AnimatedBuilder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedBuilder-class.html) or [ValueListenableBuilder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ValueListenableBuilder-class.html).

  

## Curved Animation

[This](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/CurvedAnimation-class.html) is super useful when we want to take an ordinary animation and apply a curve to it. With a staggered animation we want to apply the [Interval](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Interval-class.html) which is actually a Curve but also [takes a Curve](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Interval/curve.html), might be a bit confusing but very powerful.

  

**FadeTransition**

[This widget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FadeTransition-class.html) automatically animates a fade to the child widget. It just needs an [Animation](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Animation-class.html) or to be more correct.. a [Listenable](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/Listenable-class.html).
