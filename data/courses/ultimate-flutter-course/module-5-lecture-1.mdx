## Flutter Mocking packages

There are two packages that are the main ones which are [mockito](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito) and [mocktail](https://pub.dev/packages/mocktail). You are free to use whichever you like the most. I personally prefer [mocktail](https://pub.dev/packages/mocktail) as it doesn't require code-generation which is a huge plus as it can be quite tedious to do.

  

We use mocks to make sure that our dependencies (things like the repository) do not rely on services/APIs' that we have no control over!
