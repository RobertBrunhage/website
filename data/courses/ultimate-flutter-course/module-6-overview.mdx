## Some different topics that that is good to be aware of

*   [Implicit Animations](https://docs.flutter.dev/codelabs/implicit-animations#:~:text=With%20implicit%20animations%2C%20you%20can,you%20don't%20have%20to.)
*   [Custom Implicit Animations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KiPEqzJIKQ)
*   [Explicit Animations](https://docs.flutter.dev/codelabs/explicit-animations#:~:text=Explicit%20animations%20are%20a%20set,t%20achieve%20using%20implicit%20animations.)
*   [AnimationController](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/AnimationController-class.html)
*   [Curves](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Curve-class.html) and [Tweens](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Tween-class.html)
*   [CurvedAnimation](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/CurvedAnimation-class.html)

  

These are tools that we can use to implement what I would call "Solid Animations". This is just a made-up word by me, but I think it's important to not get pulled away by watching Dribbble where the animations are often way over the top and actually annoying to use in real apps. Most of the time, what apps really need is very simple animations that just add to the experience of the app.
