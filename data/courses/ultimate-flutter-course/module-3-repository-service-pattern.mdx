## Repository-service pattern

My favorite article of all time regarding this topic is probably [The Repository-Service Pattern with DI and ASP.NET 5.0](https://exceptionnotfound.net/the-repository-service-pattern-with-dependency-injection-and-asp-net-core/) by [Matthew Jones](https://exceptionnotfound.net/the-repository-service-pattern-with-dependency-injection-and-asp-net-core/). Sure it's in another framework and language but if you have gotten to this part you will probably understand most of the code examples he has written in **C#**

. I highly recommend you to read this through and in the end, decide whether or not your like this approach. I have been using it for a while now and makes the flow incredibly easy to follow once you know the basics of it!
