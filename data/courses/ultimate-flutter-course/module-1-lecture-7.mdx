## Navigation

Now I showed the most basic type of navigation and to be honest, there are more ways of doing navigation than I would like ðŸ˜…. We might cover this in a bonus module but if you want to learn more about navigation you can [read about it here](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/navigation) or you could take a look at a [new navigation package](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) written by [Chris Sells](https://twitter.com/csells) who is the Google product manager on Flutter.
