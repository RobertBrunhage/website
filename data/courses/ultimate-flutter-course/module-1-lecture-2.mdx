## Theming

Theming is one of those parts that are quite **hard to get right**. I **recommend** reading up a bit more about the [documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/design/themes). But generally, there are tons of **different approaches**. The most important part here is that it's possible for you to have the code related to themes in **one place**. As soon as you are setting specific colors etc throughout the app it will be a headache to implement light/dark mode features.

## ColorScheme

This is a great way of making sure the app uses the theme color in all those small spaces you might forget. Looking at the documentation:

"A set of thirteen colors that can be used to configure the color properties of most components."

This refers to a lot of widgets use for example "themeColor[400]", and the color scheme just makes it easy to cover those cases. The</span> [documentation](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ThemeData-class.html) <span style="background-color: rgb(253, 253, 253); color: rgb(33, 33, 33);">on ThemeData is great so I recommend it a read!
