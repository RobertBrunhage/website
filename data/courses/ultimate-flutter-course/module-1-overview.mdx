# Essentials
- Source code

# Official resources

# Important notes
Every lecture has a commit correlated. If you look in the github repo and check the "commits" page you will see all the lectures in a commit form

I highly recommend following the course with the exact package versions I use in the course. This will be explained in the course but for whatever reason you miss that, here are all the versions.
