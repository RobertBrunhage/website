#### The three pillars of why

Ignore that title I just came up with it ðŸ™ƒ **BUT** they are:

*   Time-saving
*   confidence
*   prevention of bugs

  

To me, one of the biggest wins of testing is probably that you will refactor the code a lot more often. As long as you have tests, you can be confident that the refactoring will not break a current implementation!
