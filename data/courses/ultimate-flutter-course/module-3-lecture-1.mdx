## API key

To follow along you either have to generate an API key OR use the one I have in the course. I recommend creating your own though!

  

## API documentation

This is a super important part of making API requests and is something I highly recommend having side by side when doing requests. For the full documentation of the API we are using, you can find it on [https://developers.themoviedb.org/3](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3).

  

## Dart Define

This is a super handy command if you want to pass a value to your application to be then used as you want. There is a great [blog about it here](https://itnext.io/flutter-1-17-no-more-flavors-no-more-ios-schemas-command-argument-that-solves-everything-8b145ed4285d) as well as I got a video on it on my [YouTube channel here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbRBV6MvLqE) (a bit old but still works).

  

When you start adding more dart-define variables it can be nice to not have to do it through the command line and in that case I recommend writing it in the config file for VSCode if that is your editor. [Here is an example of how that can be done](https://dartcode.org/docs/using-dart-define-in-flutter/).
